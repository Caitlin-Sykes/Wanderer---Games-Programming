# Wanderer---Games-Programming
<p> Hi! Sometimes Wanderer can fail to load, normally during the procedural generation aspect of the game. This is due to an infinite loop that I spent hours trying to fix, but failed to do. If it does this, the best thing to do is to just restart the game. I'm sorry for the inconvenience. In this case of this, to skip the tutorial press C and 8 together.
